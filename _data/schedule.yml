In the cloud however, there are many tasks that need to run across the platform and not just on one virtual machine. And if you are using Azure SQL Databases, you don't even have the Agent available. Powershell is the language of choice to automate but where and how do you host the scripts, and how do you schedule execution of these scripts? This session is a an introduction into Azure Automation using Runbooks and Azure DSC specifically aimed at DBAs. All demos will be based on typical tasks a 'Cloud DBA' will need to perform."

In this session we will learn to embrace the power in PowerShell to allow us to sit back and relax..... or rather focus on the real work of designing better, faster systems instead of fighting for short time slots when we can do actual work. Along the way we will see that we can benefit from the wide world of PowerShell expertise and avoid re-inventing the wheel, again!"
